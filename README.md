# Project Overview
As a Junior BI Analyst at Plant Co., a global plant company, I was tasked with analyzing sales performance data over the past three years. Utilizing Power BI, I developed an interactive performance report focusing on key metrics such as Gross Profit, Quantity Sold, and Sales Revenue. This project demonstrates my proficiency in data cleaning, modeling, and visualization to support data-driven decision-making.

# Data Collection and Preparation
The analysis was conducted using the Plant_DTS.xls dataset, which includes sales data spanning three years. Key steps in data preparation included:

Data Cleaning:
- Removed duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.
- Renamed columns for clarity and consistency.
- Corrected data types to facilitate accurate analysis.
- Created a virtual table to support advanced calculations.

Tools Used: Power Query within Power BI for data cleaning and transformation.

# Data Modeling
To enable insightful analysis, I focused on creating robust DAX measures and establishing an efficient data model:

- DAX Measures:
  - Year-to-Date (YTD) Measures: Calculated YTD Gross Profit, Quantity Sold, and Sales Revenue to assess current year performance.
  - Prior Year-to-Date (PYTD) Measures: Computed PYTD metrics to facilitate year-over-year comparisons.

- Data Model:
  - Established relationships between tables using unique identifiers.
  - Designed a star schema to optimize query performance and ensure data integrity.

# Data Visualization
The Power BI report comprises several key components:

1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
   - Displayed YTD and PYTD metrics for Gross Profit, Quantity Sold, and Sales Revenue.
   - Included variance indicators to highlight performance changes year-over-year.

2. Trend Analysis:
   - Line charts illustrating monthly trends over the three-year period.
   - Enabled identification of seasonal patterns and growth trajectories.

3. Product Performance:
   - Bar charts showcasing top-performing products based on sales revenue and quantity sold.
   - Provided insights into product profitability and sales distribution.

4. Geographical Analysis:
   - Maps highlighting sales performance across different regions.
   - Assisted in identifying high-performing areas and potential markets for expansion.

Interactive Features:
- Slicers: Allowed users to filter data by year, product category, and region.
- Drill-Throughs: Enabled detailed analysis by drilling down into specific data points.

# Key Insights
- Sales Growth: Identified a consistent increase in sales revenue over the three-year period, with a notable peak during the spring season.
- Top Products: Determined that certain product lines significantly outperformed others, contributing to a substantial portion of total sales.
- Regional Performance: Revealed that specific regions exhibited higher sales volumes, suggesting opportunities for targeted marketing efforts.

# Conclusion
This project highlights my ability to transform raw sales data into meaningful insights through effective data cleaning, modeling, and visualization techniques. The interactive Power BI report serves as a valuable tool for stakeholders to monitor performance and make informed strategic decisions.
