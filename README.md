## Introduction
This is a portfolio project to demonstrate my skills and ability on manipulating sales performance data on a Year to Day basis.

## Scenario
I am a Junior BI Analyst at Plant Co., a world-wide plant company. I've been tasked to complete a performance report over the past three years using Power BI. The performanc report should include Gross Profit, Quantity, and Sales.

## Process
### Data Cleaning
I use Power Query to investigate and clean the data by removing duplicates, renaming columns, correcting the data type, and creating a virtual table.

### Data Modeling
The second step in this project is to focus on the DAX measures. Since there are three years of data, I creat measures of the YTD and the PYTD in terms of Gross Profit, Quantity, and Sales. From there, the report is able to show clearly the data respectively.
Besides DAX measures, I ensure the data model is usable and valid by linking the unique ID and create a star schema.

### Data Visualisation
After preparing all the necessary calculated columns, I start working on visualising the data. In this report, I've included different kinds of visual such as scatter chart, treemap, and waterfall chart to provide insight to stakeholders. 
Conditional formatting is another important key in data visualisation. Within the report, various conditional formatting is added, such as the formatting of YTD vs PYTD value, the switch, and the title of different charts.

## Conclusion
I believe this project can demonstrate my passion and skills in data analysis, specially in using Power BI to calculate and visualise data, so that the stakeholders can get some insights from the report and make a data-driven business decision.
